Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
The ticker symbol : For this firstly we need to create a variable for ticker/company name & use a function to count the number of rows for the same ticker. 
Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year : For this we need to find the opening value of the stock at the opening day & substract it with the closing value of the stock at the closing/last day. 
The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year: for this we need to divide the yearly change by the opening day stock value for each ticker/company.
The total stock volume of the stock : add all the stock volume for each ticker.
Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume" : check the highest & lowest value in the column of the calculated percentage change
Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once: loop all the worksheets together at the very begining of the code.
Negative & positive value of the percentage change should have red & Green color respectively : for this we need to count the cells & add condional formating to add colorindex function to this row, if value is > 0 then color red, Else if value is > 0 then color green
